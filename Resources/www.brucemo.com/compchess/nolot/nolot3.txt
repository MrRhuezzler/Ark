I just phoned Pierre, and he admits he is very impressed by DT-2'sresults!
So am I, and we thank you for the time you have spent on these positions.
I'll post the solutions according to Pierre as given in Gambisco 
separately, but first I'll just give you his comments on DT's outstanding
results (much much better than the best micros)

Very good. This is not an easy one!

Excellent!! and this is not supposed to be an easy one. Your score proves
you found it for the good reasons.

Well, Pierre still calls it tactics!

Very good!

Very good, but 3.Qg4 is even stronger (spassky played Qg6)
Hiarcs also finds this one, and also gives 3Qg6

All this is perfectly right, except that Pierre still thinks this is tactics.
Very deep tactics.
