We took a closer look at this position.  12. Ng5 is a sound positional
sac, but depending on the temperament of the player, it might not be
the best move.  The published annotation gives 12. Bg5 Bg5 13. o-o as
+=, but white could play 13. h3 instead and white appears to have a simple
positional squeeze.  The critical line in the 12. Ng5 variation turns out
to be 12. Ng5 Bd1 13. Ne6 Qb8 14. Ng7 Kd8 15. Kd1.  Black's queen and rooks
are temporarily out of play, black is up a pawn, but white has a protected
passed pawn, and lots of pressure.  (The annotator gave one line that
ended "with the attack":).  From DT-2's point of view, The Bg5 line was
gaining 0.20 pawn after each iteration, and so was the Ng5 line.  Except
that the Bg5 line has about a 0.20 pawn lead at the same depth.  There
appears to be no kill in the Ng5 line when black king goes to d8
instead of the f file.  Black would have to give up the extra pawn to
activate the queen and the rooks, and while white is definitely better, black
is not without counter play.  On the deepest search that we checked out,
black's evaluation stopped dropping at around -1.4 pawns, and black's pieces
were becoming active.

First, 19. ... Bf5 was played instantly (at 6 ply) by both DT-1 and DT-2,
and within 30 seconds, both thought that black is winning big.

A interesting line is instead of playing 17. Ke1 as in the game, playing
17. c5!?.  Black's attack looks menacing, but there is no obvious win.

13. ... ab5!! seems clearly the best move in the position, even though
Ivanchuk did not see all the complications over the board, and we cannot
establish that it necessarily wins.  It probably would tie down the
machine for a few days to find the move.  Perhaps we will try it sometime
later.

It is not clear to us either whether 1. Ng5!? actually works.
