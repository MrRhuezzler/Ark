<p>Chess contains many forcing tactical sequences.&nbsp; If someone takes your 
bishop with a knight, you'd better take their knight back.</p>
<p>Alpha-beta search is not particularly tolerant of this kind of thing.&nbsp; 
You pass a depth parameter to the function, and when the depth gets to zero, it 
is done, even if someone's queen is hanging.</p>
<p>A method of dealing with this is called &quot;quiescent search&quot;.&nbsp; When 
alpha-beta runs out of depth, rather than calling &quot;Evaluate()&quot;, a quiescent 
search function is called instead.&nbsp; This function evaluates the position, 
while being careful to avoid overlooking extremely obvious tactical conditions.</p>
<p>Essentially, a quiescent search is an evaluation function that takes into 
account some dynamic possibilities.</p>
<p>The classic quiescent search searches only captures.&nbsp; This causes a 
problem because captures are not compulsory in chess.&nbsp; If a position is 
even, but if the only capture available to you is QxP (losing a queen), you 
aren't compelled to capture the pawn, and the quiescent search shouldn't be 
forced to capture it either.</p>
<p>Instead, the side to move is given a choice:&nbsp; make a capture or do 
nothing.&nbsp; Some people refer to doing nothing as &quot;standing pat&quot;, a term 
taken from poker, which means to go with the cards you have now rather than 
discarding some and drawing replacements from the deck.</p>
<p>Here's the code:</p>
<p class="c-code">int Quies(int alpha, int beta)</p>
<p class="c-code">{</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; val = Evaluate();</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (val &gt;= beta)</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return beta;</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (val &gt; alpha)</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alpha = val;</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GenerateGoodCaptures();</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (CapturesLeft()) {</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MakeNextCapture();</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; val = -Quies(-beta, 
-alpha);</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UnmakeMove();</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (val &gt;= beta)</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
return beta;</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (val &gt; alpha)</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
alpha = val;</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return alpha;</p>
<p class="c-code">}</p>
<p>This looks very similar to <a href="alphabeta.htm">alpha-beta</a>, but the 
differences are very important.&nbsp; The function calls the static evaluation, 
and if the score is good enough that it can force a cutoff without captures 
being attempted, a cutoff is immediately made (return beta).&nbsp; If the 
evaluation isn't good enough to cause a cutoff, but it's better than alpha, 
alpha is updated to reflect the static evaluation.</p>
<p>Then the captures are tried, and if any of them causes a cutoff, the search 
ends.&nbsp; Perhaps none of them is any good, which is also no problem.</p>
<p>This function has several possible outcomes.&nbsp; It's possible that the 
evaluation function will return a high enough score that the function can exit 
immediately via a beta cutoff.&nbsp; It's also possible that a capture can 
result in a beta cutoff.&nbsp; It's possible that the static evaluation will be 
bad, and none of the captures will be any good either.&nbsp; Or it is possible 
that none of the captures are any good, but the static evaluation can raise 
alpha a little bit.</p>
<p>Note that there is no &quot;depth&quot; parameter passed in to the quiescent search 
function.&nbsp; Because of this, the search can go very deep if a liberal 
definition of a &quot;good&quot; capture is applied, or if there is a long contentious 
forced capture sequence.</p>
<p>My example function doesn't detect checks, so it can't catch checkmates.&nbsp; 
It is possible to make one that does by immediately asking if the side to move 
is in check, and if so, instead of doing &quot;Evaluate()&quot;, and checking for a 
cutoff, instead the function calls alpha-beta with a depth of one.&nbsp; For 
example:</p>
<p class="c-code">int Quies(int alpha, int beta)</p>
<p class="c-code">{</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (InCheck())</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return AlphaBeta(1, 
alpha, beta);</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; val = Evaluate();</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (val &gt;= beta)</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return beta;</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (val &gt; alpha)</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alpha = val;</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GenerateGoodCaptures();</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (CapturesLeft()) {</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MakeNextCapture();</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; val = -Quies(-beta, 
-alpha);</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UnmakeMove();</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (val &gt;= beta)</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
return beta;</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (val &gt; alpha)</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
alpha = val;</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return alpha;</p>
<p class="c-code">}</p>
<p>This version will find mates in quiescence if they involve captures.&nbsp; 
Which version to use is a matter of taste and testing.</p>
<p>What to call a &quot;good&quot; capture is also a matter of taste and testing.&nbsp; If 
you allow any capture, and search them in any old order, you'll destroy the 
efficiency of your search and create a <i>quiescent search explosion</i>, which 
will result in dramatically reduced depth and may cause a program crash.</p>
<p>There are a couple of obvious was of trying to avoid a quiescent explosion.</p>
<h1><a name="MVVLVA"></a>MVV/LVA</h1>
<p>&quot;MVV/LVA&quot; stands for &quot;Most Valuable Victim/Least Valuable Attacker&quot;.&nbsp; 
It's a move ordering technique that is designed to be applied very cheaply.&nbsp; 
The idea is always to search the best capture first.&nbsp; This technique 
assumes that the best capture will be the one that captures the biggest piece.&nbsp; 
If more than one of your pieces can capture a big piece, the assumption is made 
that it is best to capture with the smallest piece.</p>
<p>What this means is that PxQ is going to come first (assuming king in check is 
handled some other way).&nbsp; Next comes NxQ or BxQ, then RxQ, then QxQ, then 
KxQ.&nbsp; Followng that is PxR, B/NxR, RxR, QxR, KxR, and so on.</p>
<p>This works better than nothing, but it is obvious that there are some glaring 
problems.&nbsp; RxR is searched before PxB, even if the rook is defended.</p>
<p>MVV/LVA will solve the quiescent explosion problem, but it will leave you 
with bloated quiescent search trees.</p>
<p>The advantage of MVV/LVA is that this is easy to implement and it results in 
a high nodes/second.&nbsp; The disadvantage is that your search is inefficient 
-- you spend most of your time evaluating losing captures, so you search less 
deeply.</p>
<h1><a name="SEE"></a>SEE</h1>
<p>&quot;SEE&quot; stands for &quot;Static Exchange Evaluation&quot;.&nbsp; It's much more 
complicated than MVV/LVA, but allows for more accurate move ordering, and it 
allows for some captures to be discarded.</p>
<p>You can't discard QxP in MVV/LVA, because it's very possible that the pawn is 
undefended, which would mean that QxP is a good move.&nbsp; Of course, if the 
pawn is defended, I doubt that you gain anything significant by searching this 
move at all.&nbsp; With a SEE, you can figure out if QxP is a losing capture, 
and if so, either order the capture so that it is searched last, or simply prune 
it.</p>
<p>I don't have sample code for SEE yet, but how it works is that you apply a 
routine that resolves the captures, and then order moves by the amount of 
material that appears to be won.</p>
<p>SEE allows you to prune &quot;bad&quot; capturing moves very drastically, without many 
important captures being pruned out erroneously, and it improves move ordering.&nbsp; 
Another thing you can do is prune out good captures, if they don't seem good 
enough.&nbsp; If you are down a rook, a capture that wins a pawn is probably not 
worth trying in quiescent search.</p>
<p>I suspect that a program that uses SEE will be stronger than the same program 
using MVV/LVA.&nbsp; The problem is writing the routine, and designing your data 
structures so the routine can be efficient.</p>
<h1>Quiescent search is not perfect</h1>
<p>It is very possible and in fact very likely that quiescent search will make 
mistakes.&nbsp; This is a sad reality, but at least it's happening way out at 
the tips, where searches tend to be pretty stupid (a one-ply search is never 
going to be very good), so perhaps this is not a big deal.</p>
<p>If it were possible to make a more accurate quiescent search with no loss in 
speed, I'm sure that a program would be stronger than it was before.&nbsp; 
However, I think it's important to understand the tradeoff that is being made if 
you try to make your quiescent search extremely powerful at the expense of time.&nbsp; 
If making the quiescent search smarter costs you some number of plies of 
full-width search, it may not be worth it to make it smarter.</p>
