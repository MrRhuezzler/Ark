<p>In chess, both players know where the pieces are, they alternate moves, and 
they are free to make any legal move.&nbsp; The object of the game is to 
checkmate the other player, to avoid being checkmated, or to achieve a draw if 
that's the best thing given the circumstances.</p>
<p>A chess program selects moves via use of a <i>search</i> function.&nbsp; A 
search function is a function that is passed information about the game, and 
tries to find the best move for side that the program is playing.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to write a search function, and I don't want to stifle 
creativity by only talking about one of them, but I want these pages to focus on 
practical methods.&nbsp; I figure that people who don't have any interest in 
writing a chess program might want to understand how the good ones work, and 
those who are considering writing a chess program are probably interested in 
following in the footsteps of those who have written strong programs.</p>
<p>It is possible that everything I say is crap, and it's important to keep an 
open mind about this.&nbsp; What I say here may not have anything to do with 
techniques that will produce the strongest program.&nbsp; Keep this in mind, and 
if you can think of a better way to do it, go for it.</p>
<p>Modern chess programs view a game of chess as a tree.&nbsp; You have the root 
position, which is the position on the board now.&nbsp; From this position, the 
side to move can choose amongst some number of legal moves.&nbsp; These legal 
moves result in <a href="glossary.htm#successor">successor positions</a>, which 
are positions that the side to move essentially gets to pick from.&nbsp; It's 
not the move that you are selecting, it's the position.</p>
<p>Each of these successor positions will result in a position that your 
opponent can consider to be the root position, and they will choose from amongst 
their successors.</p>
<p>What you end up with is something that looks like a family tree.&nbsp; You 
have the ancestors at the top, then you have their children, and then you have 
their children's children, and so on.&nbsp; The tree is very, very bushy, since 
each position tends to have about 35 successors in chess.</p>
<p>Ideally, you would like to write a program that can work its way through all 
of the generations, until it finds a checkmates or draws, then choose the path 
that will get it to the best possible outcome.&nbsp; It is theoretically 
possible to do this, but in practicality, it is impossible to search most 
positions this deeply.</p>
<p>So what is done instead is that the tree is searched as deeply as possible 
within a given time frame, and in those positions where you don't know how the 
game will end, you look at the position, take a guess, and assign a value to 
this position based upon the guess.</p>
<p>So now you have this giant family-tree structure, with all of the possible 
outcomes labeled according to their real or guessed value, and you want to make 
sense out of it, and pick the move <i>now</i> that will allow you to reach the 
position that seems to be the best.</p>
<p>You do this by using a tree search algorithm.&nbsp; The most obvious one is
<a href="minmax.htm">min-max</a>.</p>
