<h1>Extra speed with no down-side</h1>
</font>

<p>Null-move forward pruning allows a chess program to experience a dramatic 
reduction in branching factor with some manageable risk of missing something 
important.&nbsp; It results in a dramatic improvement in search depth, and in most 
cases markedly decreases the amount of required to find tactics.&nbsp; It does this 
by pruning out a lot of useless crap and leaving mostly good stuff.</p>
<p>The technique has been described in several publications, but the article 
that got everyone thinking about null-move is an ICCA Journal article by Chrilly 
Donniger, published in September 1993.</p>
<p>Imagine a chess position in a tree somewhere.&nbsp; Your program is going to 
search each of the legal moves in this position to a depth of D.&nbsp; If any of 
those moves result in a score that exceeds beta, you are going to return beta 
immediately.&nbsp; If any of them exceed alpha, but don't exceed beta, you are going 
to remember the move and the score, since it could be part of the principal 
variation.&nbsp; If all of them are &lt;= alpha, you are going to return alpha.</p>
<p>Null-move forward pruning is a step you perform prior to searching any of the 
moves.&nbsp; You ask the question, &quot;If I do <i>nothing</i> here, can the opponent do
<i>anything</i>?&quot;</p>
<p>Note that in the regular case described two paragraphs ago, you are not 
asking this question.&nbsp; You are asking about the best way to hurt the opponent.&nbsp; 
Asking if the opponent can hurt you is something very different.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are a lot of cases where the opponent can't hurt 
you.&nbsp; Let's say that you are up a rook, and none of your pieces are <i>en-prise</i>.&nbsp; 
In this case, the opponent makes some random move, then you still bash them, 
since you are up a rook.&nbsp; The point of null-move forward pruning is to simply 
get rid of such nonsense without having to spend a lot of time on it.</p>
<p>This is kind of like a fighter expressing heavy confidence in his ability, by 
giving the opponent a free shot.&nbsp; <i>If the opponent can't knock the fighter 
down with a free shot, chances are he's going to lose the fight if the fighter 
goes to the trouble of hitting him.</i></p>
<p>I'll stop talking around the problem now and explain&nbsp; how this works in the 
case of computer chess.&nbsp; Before you search any moves, and in fact before you 
generate any moves, you do a reduced-depth search, with the <i>opponent</i> to 
move first, and if that search results in a score &gt;= beta, you simply return 
beta without searching any moves.</p>
<p>The idea is that you give the opponent a free shot at you, and if your 
position is still so good that you exceed beta, you assume that you'd also 
exceed beta if you went and searched all of your moves.</p>
<p>The reason this saves time is that this initial search is made with <i>
reduced depth</i>.&nbsp; The depth reduction factor is called R.&nbsp; So rather than 
searching all of your moves to depth D, you search your <i>opponent's</i> moves 
with a depth of D-R.&nbsp; An excellent value of R is 2.&nbsp; So, if for instance you 
were going to search all of your moves to depth 6, you end up searching all of 
your opponent's moves to depth 4.</p>
<p>This results in a massive time savings, and a practical speedup of a ply or 
two.&nbsp; That's a vastly huge amount!</p>
<p>Here is the source, added to an alpha-beta search, with changes 
highlighted:</p>

<p class="c-code"><span class="highlit-code">#define R&nbsp;&nbsp; 2</span></p>
<p class="c-code">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="c-code">int AlphaBeta(int depth, int 
alpha, int beta)<br>
{<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (depth == 0)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return Evaluate();<br>
<span class="highlit-code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MakeNullMove();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; val = -AlphaBeta(depth - 1 - R, -beta, -beta + 1);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UnmakeNullMove();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (val &gt;= beta)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return beta;<br>
</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GenerateLegalMoves();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (MovesLeft()) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MakeNextMove();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; val = -AlphaBeta(depth - 1, -beta, -alpha);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UnmakeMove();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (val &gt;= beta) // Delete these to get straight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return beta; // min-max instead of alpha-beta.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (val &gt; alpha)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; alpha = val;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return alpha;<br>
}</p>

<p>I'm using a trick in this code.&nbsp; I want to see if the 
score of the null-move search is beta or better.&nbsp; If it's not beta or better, I 
don't care how much worse than beta it is, so I use a minimal window, in order 
to try to get more cutoffs faster.&nbsp; Essentially I'm calling it with (beta - 1, 
beta), but since you have to reverse alpha and beta and negate them when you 
recurse, it comes out the way it appears in the source code.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that this doesn't work if the 
side to move is in check (because the opponent immediately takes the king).&nbsp; The 
degree to which null-move forward pruning will be allowed to happen recursively 
must also be considered, since if you let several of them follow in a row the 
search degenerates down to nothing.&nbsp; One obvious attempt is to not allow two 
null-move searches to occur without an intervening &quot;real&quot; move.&nbsp; Another idea is 
to allow exactly two null-move searches before forcing a &quot;real&quot; move.&nbsp; In 
practice these seem to work about equally well.</p>

<h1>Well, almost no down-side</h1>
</font>

<p>Unfortunately, null-move forward pruning doesn't work in some cases.&nbsp; A big 
assumption is made -- the assumption that making a move will result in a higher 
score than not making a move.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are a whole class of 
positions where this is not true, and these are common enough that there is even 
a name for them.&nbsp; These positions are called <i>zugzwangs</i>.&nbsp; A zugzwang is a 
position where you are fine if you don't move, but your position collapses if 
you are forced to move.&nbsp; Here is a classic example:</p>

<font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
<p><img border="0" src="images/nullmo12.gif" width="448" height="448"></p>
</font>

<p>In this position, if white is forced to move, he has to play Kb2, and black 
plays Kd2 and the pawn queens.&nbsp; If white doesn't have to move, then black plays 
Kc3 and the position is a draw.&nbsp; (This is actually a mutual zugzwang, since both 
sides suffer from having to move, but that's beside the point.)</p>
<p>If this position were reached, and null-move forward pruning were attempted, 
it could indicate that black has no threat, because in fact black doesn't have a 
threat.&nbsp; Black is waiting for white to wreck his own position, which is 
something different.</p>
<p>For this reason, null-move forward pruning is not used, at least in a 
straightforward way, in endgames.&nbsp; If you do try to use it in endgames, very bad 
things will happen very often.</p>
<p>Another, more nasty example, is as follows:</p>

<font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
<p><img border="0" src="images/nullmo13.gif" width="448" height="448"></p>
</font>

<p>This position is taken from Goetsch and Campbell's &quot;Experiments with the 
Null-Move Heuristic&quot; published in Computers, Chess, and Cognition, ISBN 
0-387-97415-6.</p>
<p>In this position, with white to move, white can't do anything and is mated on 
the next move.&nbsp; A two-ply search will spot this with no problem:&nbsp; 1. &lt;any&gt; Qg2#.</p>
<p>If you try to use null-move forward pruning here, something bad will happen.&nbsp; 
We'd been planning to do a full-width two-ply search, so let's instead do a 
zero-ply search for the other side and try to detect threats.&nbsp; In zero plies, 
black can't make any moves, so the &quot;Evaluate&quot; function is called, and returns +5 
or so, since white is up a rook.&nbsp; This is probably above beta, so the search 
returns beta.</p>
<p>This is not what should have happened!&nbsp; The search should have returned a 
very small value, indicating that white is mated.</p>
<p>What we see here is a type of horizon effect that is common when null-move 
forward pruning is used.&nbsp; Without null-move forward pruning, white makes a move 
that doesn't achieve anything, and then there are enough plies of search depth 
(one in this case) for black to kill white.&nbsp; With null-move forward pruning and 
with an R of sufficiently high value (for instance R=2), white can do nothing, 
and yet black doesn't have enough depth left to see the win.</p>
<p>This example is may strike you as odd, given that it occurs with a very 
shallow search, but there are a great many example cases where this happens with 
just enough search depth that the tactic could have been seen with a normal 
search, but is missed by null-move forward pruning.&nbsp; In fact, this pattern of 
black queen on h3 and pawn on f3 is an extremely dangerous case for chess 
programs.</p>
<p>Another problem with null-move forward pruning is that it introduces
<a href="instability.htm">search instability</a>.&nbsp; Whether or not the 
null-move search succeeds or fails has something to do with the value of beta.&nbsp; 
The next time this node is visited, the value of beta might be different, so the 
search might have an irrationally different value.&nbsp; You could pass in an 
alpha-beta window of (7, 30) and the search might fail high, but if you pass in 
(7, 50), it could fail low.</p>
<p>In practice, the search speedup outweighs the occasional tactical mistake and 
the addition of search instability.</p>

<font face="Book Antiqua, Times New Roman, Times">
<h1>Some ideas</h1>
</font>

<p>It's interesting to fiddle around trying to find a better value for R than 
two.&nbsp; You can try one, three, four, some larger number, or a number that changes 
depending upon depth of search, how much material is on the board, etc.&nbsp; I've 
never been able to do better than straight R=2, but there has been some research 
that suggests that other values might be good, and there are a few people who 
are using R=3 in at least part of the tree.</p>
<p>It's also tempting to try to figure out a way to use null-move forward 
pruning in endgames, through some sort of verification search.&nbsp; If your 
null-move search fails high, you do a normal search to reduced depth, and see if 
that fails high as well.&nbsp; This seems to me like it&nbsp; might be very expensive, but 
it could be worth looking at.</p>
<p>There are other enhancements that are worth trying, but I'm not trying to 
make a complete list here.&nbsp; You can look in the Donninger article, the article 
in Computers, Chess, and Cognition, or at any of Ernst Heinz' articles about 
null-move forward pruning and related topics.</p>
