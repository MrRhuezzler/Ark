<h1>Why repetition detection is necessary</h1>
<p>It's important to figure out the repetition draw problem.&nbsp; If a position 
repeats three times with the same side to move, a draw can be claimed.&nbsp; 
It's very bad if a program is ahead by a rook and gets into a situation where it 
is cycling through a couple of checks forever.&nbsp; The opponent claims a draw 
in a position that is easily winning.</p>
<p>Solving this problem is a matter of detecting previously played played 
positions and doing the appropriate thing.&nbsp; If a program understands 
repetitions it can aim for them or avoid them as the board situation warrants.&nbsp; 
A program can attempt to find a perpetual check if it is losing, and it can 
avoid this situation if it is winning.</p>
<h1>A fairly trivial choice before we start</h1>
<p>There are two kinds of positions that can be repeated.&nbsp; <i>Game history 
positions</i> are positions that have actually been played on the board, in the 
game.&nbsp; <i>Tree positions</i> are positions that have occurred in the line 
the program is now searching.&nbsp; They haven't been played on the board yet, 
but the program has managed to think about undoing a move and playing it again.</p>
<p>I think that it is clear that repetition of tree positions should be 
immediately detected and handled.&nbsp; Traditionally, a draw score is returned 
in these cases, but I have heard that some programs return a deliberately 
positive score if there is a middlegame perpetual check, as long as the program 
is doing the checking.&nbsp; This is supposed to reflect the idea that if you 
find a perpetual check, there is often more.&nbsp; If repetitions within the 
tree are not handled, the program will not see cases involving perpetual check 
and other repetition draws.</p>
<p>It's not as obvious what to do about positions that appear in both the tree 
and game history.&nbsp; If a position has appeared twice in the game history, 
and once in the tree, that can be treated as a draw, since if that position 
appears on the board again it is a draw.&nbsp; The difficult case is a position 
that has appeared once in the game and once in the tree.</p>
<p>Many programs treat these positions as draws.&nbsp; This causes a program to 
efficiently attempt to achieve a draw via repetition if it is in trouble and the 
opponent wants to repeat.&nbsp; The down-side is that the program will sometimes 
make unnatural moves.</p>
<p>I have seen a couple of examples in actual play.&nbsp; One of them involved a 
game between Gnuchess and my program.&nbsp; Gnuchess had a win in a K+P ending 
and missed it, and the programs wandered off into a series of drawn positions.&nbsp; 
Eventually, they wandered back to the position where Gnuchess missed a win.&nbsp; 
My program was happy to repeat this position, because it scored it as a draw, 
since it had already occurred in the game history.&nbsp; Of course, Gnuchess 
found the win the second time through.</p>
<p>Another game was between my program and a human master named Greg Kennedy.&nbsp; 
Kennedy was up two pawns, but made a bad move that allowed a simple tactic such 
as a knight fork, which won one of the pawns back.&nbsp; Kennedy saw that his 
king was in check, and he had to move it.&nbsp; He moved it back to the square 
that it had just been on.&nbsp; My program, rather than taking the pawn, 
resulting in a position where it was a pawn down, decided instead to undo its 
last move, leading to a repetition of the position two plies previous.&nbsp; Its 
repetition cause it to &quot;expect&quot; that Kennedy would move his king back and let 
the program fork him again.&nbsp; Of course he didn't, and he remained two pawns 
up.</p>
<p>It's possible to create many other hypothetical cases.&nbsp; A strong human 
player has an overwhelming attack, but messes up and allows the program to 
escape with its king, so all the human has now is a perpetual check, since he's 
down material and has no mate.&nbsp; The program would happily move its king 
right back into the situation it just escaped from, since those positions are 
repetitions and are therefore considered draws.</p>
<p>In my programs I have fixed this by ignoring positions that are repeated once 
in the game history and once in the tree.&nbsp; This solves the problems 
described above but it introduces some new problems.&nbsp; The program will repeat positions a couple of times, so sometimes it plays 
very annoying chess, since it is not forced to at least <i>appear</i> to be 
making progress.&nbsp; This might tend to bother human opponents, or 
opposing operators at computer chess tournaments.&nbsp; It could also cost the 
program wins, because when it gets into difficult endgame positions, it isn't 
really forced to make progress, and could diddle around for a long time, while 
getting closer and closer to the fifty-move limit.</p>
<p>The choice of which system to use is a matter of taste.</p>
<h1>Possible implementations</h1>
<p>There are several ways that repetitions can be detected.&nbsp; One of them is 
in use in Tom Kerrigan's TSCP, which he credits John Stanback for.&nbsp; The 
comments in the code claims that it works, but there is no information about how 
or why it works, so I don't know what it does.&nbsp; If you want to understand 
it, you'll have to look in TSCP.</p>
<p>Implementations that I can understand and explain involve
<a href="zobrist.htm">Zobrist keys</a>.&nbsp; If you want to implement a
<a href="hashing.htm">transposition hash table</a>, you'll have already 
implemented Zobrist keys, so you already have them available.&nbsp; What you 
need to do with these Zobrist keys is recognize that the key corresponding to 
current position within a tree search is equal to they key corresponding to a 
position further back in the game tree.</p>
<p>One method of doing this involves maintaining a first-in last-out stack of 
keys in the current line, plus keys from the game history.&nbsp; In order to 
detect a repetition, the stack is iterated, and keys are compared, in order to 
see if the current key is already in the stack.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to go through the entire list, it's only necessary to go 
backwards until a pawn move or a capture is encountered, since these moves lead 
to irreversible changes in the game history.&nbsp; You can never have a 
repetition of a position that occurred before the last capture or pawn move 
made.</p>
<p>This sounds like it would be expensive to do, and perhaps it is, but I 
believe that some programs are doing it like this.</p>
<p>Early on in my chess programming experience, I wrote a Usenet post about 
hashing, and I received a response from Ken Thompson, author of Belle (amongst 
many other achievements).&nbsp; He told me that he detected repetitions by using 
the transposition hash table, as follows:</p>
<p>The idea is to set an &quot;open&quot; flag in the position's transposition table 
element when the hash table is probed.&nbsp; This flag stays set until the 
position is no longer being searched, meaning when the search function returns a 
value for that position.&nbsp; At any given time, the only nodes that are &quot;open&quot; 
are nodes that are in the game history, or are in the current line in the tree 
search, so if the hash table probe encounters an open node, it must be because 
the current position has occurred somewhere before.</p>
<p>This has the advantage that it uses data structures that are already present 
in the typical chess program, but there are a few problems with this idea.&nbsp; 
The hash table element must be written when a node is entered, so an &quot;<a href="hashing.htm#replacement">always 
replace</a>&quot; scheme must be used.&nbsp; This isn't a problem for Thompson, since 
his scheme involves using an &quot;always replace&quot; table, but other implementations 
might not use this kind of replacement scheme.&nbsp; Another problem is that 
there can be hash table entry collisions, and they must be dealt with.&nbsp; I 
am not talking about hash key collisions which occur when two positions map to 
the same 64-bit key, I'm talking about when two particular positions want to 
share the same hash table element, which should be pretty common.&nbsp; If two 
open nodes that want to share the same hash element, it's not immediately 
obvious what to do, other than not detect repetitions on the second one.&nbsp; 
Perhaps this problem could be dealt with via a re-hashing scheme, but this seems 
like an annoying thing to add in order to support functionality that isn't 
central to what the transposition table should be doing.&nbsp; A final problem 
is that it is hard to figure out how to adapt this to a multiprocessor search 
where there might be several search threads accessing the same hash table.&nbsp; 
When an open node is encountered, it might not indicate a repetition at all, 
since it could belong to a line being searched by another processor.&nbsp; This 
problem sounds complicated to solve.</p>
<p>A simpler scheme involves making a smaller hash table.&nbsp; When a node is 
entered, the table is probed, if if the Zobrist key for the current position is 
in the table, a draw score is returned.&nbsp; Otherwise, the key is added.&nbsp; 
When the node is exited, the key is deleted.&nbsp; This is very straightforward, 
and hash element collisions can be handled easily, since the table isn't full, 
elements are managed in first-in last-out order, and there are no problems with 
replacement scheme.</p>
<p>I'm reluctant to say that this technique is better than the other, since the 
other was devised by Ken Thompson.&nbsp; There are some problems with this 
system, notably that it's an extra data structure and several extra functions 
that need to be written to manipulate it.</p>
<p>There are also some worries when a program is changed so that it can use a 
multi-processor search, but the problems that happen don't seem any more serious 
to me than the problems that are faced when a program that uses the Thompson 
scheme is converted.</p>
<p>If you want to see code for this secondary hash table scheme, check out
<a href="../gerbil/index.htm">Gerbil</a>.&nbsp; I don't include a source-code 
example here because it's rather implementation specific.</p>
