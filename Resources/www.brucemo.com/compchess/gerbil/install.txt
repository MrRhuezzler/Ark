INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Download the ZIP file to an appropriate directory, such as "c:\gerbil" or
"c:\Program Files\Gerbil", or whatever you wish.

Unzip the file.  Please note that the directory structure is not flat.  If you
use the same incredibly ancient version of pkunzip that I do, the syntax is:

    pkunzip -o -d <zipfile>.zip

You should get source files, executables, everything.  Look in the text files
for further information, particularly README.TXT.

Various licensing restrictions are covered in GPL.TXT and TOURNEY.TXT.

Release notes are in RELEASE.TXT.

You can't just run the executable by typing "gerbil" and expecting to play
chess.  In order to use the program, you need to configure it as a Winboard
engine.

If you don't have Winboard, get it from Tim Mann at:

    http://www.tim-mann.org/xboard.html

Once you have Winboard installed, the simplest way to get going is to copy
"gerbil.exe" and "gerbil.opn" into the directory with the Winboard executable,
and type:

    winboard /cp /fcp gerbil.exe

If you start making moves, it should respond.

If you want to hook up to ICC, the syntax is:

    winboard /cp /zp /fcp gerbil.exe /ics /icshost chessclub.com /icshelper timestamp.exe
